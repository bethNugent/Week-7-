    <h1>Zebras</h1>
    <p>Zebras are black animals with white stripes. This striking coloration is probably a form of camouflage. 
        It helps zebras blend into the shadows of tall grasses. It also helps them blend in when they are in 
        a herd. When clustered together, it is nearly impossible to tell one zebra from another, making it 
        difficult for predators such as lions to stalk an individual animal.</p>
